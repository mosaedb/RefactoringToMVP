# RefactoringToMVP

My attempt to implement a **real project** for: [Refactoring to MVP A way to learn MVP with real code](https://medium.com/@Miqubel/refactoring-to-mvp-b504a3774ffd).

### To make API call easy, I change:
- `GoogleBooksService` interface to `GitHubService`
- `Book` class to `Repo`
- `search` method to `listRepos`.
